# Dynamic 3D Visualization with Phyllotaxis and Spherical Interpolation Project 


In this project I am showcasing a creative implementation of a 3D visualization inspired by phyllotaxis, the mathematical arrangement of points often seen in nature, such as sunflower seeds. The piece is designed to dynamically transition between spherical and toroidal (donut-shaped) structures, using an interpolation technique. 

KEY FEATURES INCLUDED:
- Smoothly transforms between sphere and torus geometries using the lerp function for a visually compelling morphing effect.
- Gradual growth in the number of points visualized, capped at 1,000, for controlled complexity.
- Vibrant HSB color gradients mapped to the geometry for enhanced visual appeal.
- Uses perspective adjustments based on oscillation to create a more immersive experience.
- Learned and implemented phyllotaxis for point distribution.
