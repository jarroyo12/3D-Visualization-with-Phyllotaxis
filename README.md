# Project 03 - Advanced Techniques


In this project I am exploring the phyllotaxis technique. Typically phyllotaxis is usually 2D but I've changed it to 3D to make it more dynamic. I plot points based on angles and radii calculated using the phyllotaxis formula. But instead of keeping them in a flat spiral I use spherical coordinates to form a 3D shape. To make things more interesting I have animated the pattern and have it transitioning between a sphere (which is created using two spirals on either side of the sphere) and a torus using interpolation. This creates a squishing, morphing effect that's driven by a sine wave for smooth, continuous motion. 

I used gradients to map color across the points. The gradient shifts smoothly between hues, emphasizing the spiral and radial design of the structure. I also implemented 3D techniques like rotation, scaling, and perspective transformations to make the piece feel more alive.
