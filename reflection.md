# Reflection



- What (if anything) still is not complete?
    I might want to play around with the colors, maybe add a shader but other than that it is complete. 

- If it is not complete, what is left and how are you going to address it?

- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
    I struggled in the beginning with making the phyllotaxis grow across the sphere. I also struggled with the math regarding the 'donut coordinates'/the 'torus' (trigonometry was not my favorite section of my math classes). I had to watch a video to sort of understand what values I need. 

- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?
    I gained a better understanding of polar and spherical coordinate systems. I worked with converting polar coordinates into cartesian coordinates. Understanding this helped me when using math concepts into something visual in my project. I also gained better understanding of the lerp function. I also learned how manipulate the camera and perspective. It was also really cool to understand and learn more about scaling, stretching and compressing objects overtime. And after everything was set I had fun playing around with different variables and values which got me to this final submission.
